 Predicting Crop Yield Using Object Counting and AI

Description

This project implements an AI-based crop yield prediction system using object counting and deep learning. The system detects and counts crop-related objects such as fruits, plants, or grains from agricultural field images. By combining computer vision with machine learning techniques, the project estimates crop yield accurately and supports precision farming practices.



Problem Statement

Traditional crop yield estimation methods are mostly manual, time-consuming, and often inaccurate due to environmental variations and large-scale field conditions. There is a need for an automated and intelligent system that can analyze crop images, count objects efficiently, and predict yield with higher reliability.



Objectives

To design and develop an AI-based crop yield prediction system.

To detect and count crop objects from field images using object detection models.

To compare multiple deep learning models such as YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and MobileNet-SSD.

To estimate crop yield based on object count and predictive mapping techniques.

To provide an efficient and scalable solution for smart agriculture.
